# soil-moisture-sensor-analog
Analog soil moisture sensor. Continuation of my [Chirp](https://github.com/Miceuz/PlantWateringAlarm) project. The idea behind this version is to provide an analog output for the microcontroller and increase the resolution by detecting both peaks and dips of filtered waveform.
